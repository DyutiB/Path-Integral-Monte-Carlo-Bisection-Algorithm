# Path-Integral-Monte-Carlo-Bisection-Algorithm

Code for getting stable/equilibrium configuration of interacting Wigner Molecules starting from random initial configuration. This code will calculate the positional and orientational correlation between the interacting particles, along with Lindemann ratio and nearest neighbors to estimate the different topological defects like dislocation and disclination. In our code, the interacting potention is Coulombic in nature, though changing the potential to others is easily doable. The Wigner molecules are confined by an irregular potential, can be easily changed into regular Circular or any other potential. 

The parameters to run the iteration are given in the `param.dat' file while the parameters for the irregular confinement are given in the `Votparam.dat' file.
